## 👋 Welcome!

Hello there! This is my personal collection of cybersecurity books, neatly organized and categorized for anyone who loves security as much as I do.

Since I got my first computer as a kid, I’ve been obsessed with how things work—and how to break them (ethically, of course 😉). That curiosity turned into passion, and now, I want to give back to the community with a free resource anyone can use to learn, explore, and grow in the field of cybersecurity.

## 💭 Real Talk

We live in an era of distraction. Everything is fast—notifications, trends, opportunities. It’s so easy to feel like you're falling behind, like you picked the wrong thing to focus on.

But here’s the truth: **Mastery takes time.**  
Stick to your path, even when it’s not shiny. Even when no one’s clapping yet. This library is a reminder that **deep focus** and **consistent learning** still matter.

Whether you’re starting out or knee-deep in exploits, keep going. 💻🔥

> *Also me at 3 AM: ‘If I just buffer overflow the stack and execute shellcode…’"* 😵‍💻
